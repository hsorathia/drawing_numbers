# Problem
Many older documents in an agency are handwritten. We aim to create a software tool to solve this problem.


# Solution Description
The solution to this would be image recognition, or more specifically, character recognition. This project takes a step towards character recognition by detecting digits.


# Algorithms and Data Structures

## Neural Network
A neural network is both an algorithm and data structure. 

## Algorithms
The functions are documented through sphinx documentation since we used a variety of algorithms for our website and neural network. 

## Data structures
The main data struc



# Complexity analysis


# Tools used

## PIL
PIL stands for Python imaging library and is also known as Pillow. PIL comes with a variety of imaging tools, including the ones we used to scale our image to 20x20 and back up to 28x28. 

## Numpy
Numpy is a python library that comes with utilities for linear algebra. It provids more efficient methods of array manipulation. In our neural network, we used this for shuffling, randomizing, dot products, and finding the index of the maximum value.

## MNIST
MNIST provided a dataset of handwritten digits to train our neural network in. We used this in `mnist_loader.py` to return the test cases.
